# Headphones Project

This project is a static, multi-page website for a headphone company, built as an exercise in HTML and CSS. The design is based on provided high-fidelity mockups, with a focus on implementing a responsive, clean, and modern user interface.

## Project Description

The website features a landing page that showcases the company's products and services. It includes a hero section, a "What we do" section with service icons, a testimonials section, and a contact form. The design emphasizes a sleek, minimalist aesthetic with a clear visual hierarchy.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. It transitions to a mobile-first design when the screen width is 480px or less.
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - **Links and Buttons:** All links and buttons have hover and active states that change to the color `#FF6565`.
  - **Button Opacity:** All buttons feature an opacity change to `0.9` on hover and active states.
- **Consistent Styling:** The project uses specific fonts, colors, and layout rules to maintain a cohesive brand identity throughout the pages.
- **Centralized Content:** All page content is centered and has a maximum width of 1000px, ensuring a clean and readable layout on large screens.

## Design and Fonts

The project's design is based on the following specifications:
- **Fonts:** The primary fonts used are `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin-Cycle-OT`.
- **Colors:** A color palette focused on a dark background with white and red accents.
